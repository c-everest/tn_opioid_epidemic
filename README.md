# Tennessee's Opioid Crisis

### Project overview
Opioids are a class of drugs including prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, the synthetic opioid fentanyl, and the illegal drug heroin. These drugs produce euphoria in addition to pain relief, which can lead to dependence, addiction, overdose, and death.

In the late 1990s, opioids began to be prescribed at high rates, which led to widespread misuse and ultimately created a serious national health crisis. In 2019, more than 130 people per day died from opioid-related drug overdoses in the United States. Tennessee has been one of the hardest-hit states in the opioid epidemic, with more than 1300 overdose deaths in 2018.

### Objectives
* Which Tennessee counties had a disproportionately high number of opioid prescriptions?
* Who are the top opioid prescribers for the state of Tennessee?
* What did the trend in overdose deaths due to opioids look like in Tennessee from 2015 to 2018?
* Is there an association between rates of opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths by county?
* Is there any association between a particular type of opioid and number of overdose deaths?

### Findings

The analysis revealed a disproportionate amount of opioids prescriptions in Scott County, TN. Interestingly, this has been traced back in our analysis to just one specific prescriber, who had two time more claims per Medicare enrollee than average, and prescribed popular opioids, such as Oxycodone and Hydrocodone three to four times more than other prescribers. We were not able to determine the type of opioids related to death due to limited data.
